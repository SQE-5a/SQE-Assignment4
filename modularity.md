# Modularity Requirments of our FLEX:

## Decomposability of modules
To decompose anything simply is to reduce it to smaller parts. Modular decomposability is the ability to systematically divide a problem into its various subproblems. It can be challenging to address a huge problem; however, deconstruction aids in lowering the complexity of the issue and creates distinct sub-problems. This assists in implementing the fundamental concept of modularity.

As far as our Flex Academic management system is concerned, we will add up the modularity by setting up  our github and dividing the modules and 
it's source code in an efficient manner, as done by other open-source platforms like `Dolibar`.

Now, if it comes to the modularity of Dolibar, in the scripts, it is arranged in modular structure as evident from the above image, we
will also be achieving this thing in our `FLEX`.
