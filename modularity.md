# Modularity Requirments of our FLEX:

## 1- Decomposability of modules
To decompose anything simply is to reduce it to smaller parts. Modular decomposability is the ability to systematically divide a problem into its various subproblems. It can be challenging to address a huge problem; however, deconstruction aids in lowering the complexity of the issue and creates distinct sub-problems. This assists in implementing the fundamental concept of modularity.

As far as our Flex Academic management system is concerned, we will add up the modularity by setting up  our github and dividing the modules and 
it's source code in an efficient manner, as done by other open-source platforms like `Dolibar`.

Now, if it comes to the modularity of Dolibar, in the scripts, it is arranged in modular structure as evident from the above image, we
will also be achieving this thing in our `FLEX`.

## Modular Comprehensibility
Simply, the word "understandability" refers to the capacity for comprehension. Modular understandability refers to making each module simpler for the user to grasp so that software development and customization are incredibly simple. Because of their complexity and substantial size, process models can occasionally be difficult to comprehend. It is simpler to understand the problem effectively and without any problems when using modularity understandability.

Now, if it comes to the Modular strcutre of our Flex, we will be managing it as it Dolibar is managing. They are actually having a separte module
of scripts and in which all the other modules like accountacy, bank, company etc are there. User can easily nagivate to their respective module.
If it comes to the code, each module folder contains it's own code, in `PHP` if it is the case of `Dolibar`.

When suppose, one opens the module of `Accountancy`, there is only one file of PHP, corresponding to that, which is really good and 
convenient for user to understand the stuff going around, and it is also not too complex with respect to user.
