# Performance:

## 1- Usage of CDN(Content Delivery Network):
A content delivery network, or content distribution network, is a geographically distributed network 
of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by 
distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

We will try to use CDN in our Flex Management System, because we are actually aiming to make it readily available
for not only Fast-Nuces but also any college or University in the world. So, we have to make data centres accordingly.

We will somehow try to manage a system as above, to make the data readily available for the particular region.
We aim to have big 7 servers in each of the `Continent` to make data readily available for that particular
Continent. It is all about user convenience and we try to make it easy for users.
